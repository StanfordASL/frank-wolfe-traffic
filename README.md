# Routing Framework, adapted for autonomous mobility on demand (AMoD)

This repository contains the C++14 source code, adapted from [Routing Framework](https://github.com/vbuchhold/routing-framework) (by Valentin Buchold), for computing traffic flow for AMoD systems. This code was developed for the following paper:

* Kiril Solovey, Mauro Salazar, and Marco Pavone, "Scalable and Congestion-aware Routing for Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand via Frank-Wolfe Optimization", submitted to *Robotics: Science and Systems*, 2019. See [preprint](http://asl.stanford.edu/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/Solovey.Salazar.Pavone.RSS19.pdf).

For installation guidelines, see details in [Routing Framework](https://github.com/vbuchhold/routing-framework).
